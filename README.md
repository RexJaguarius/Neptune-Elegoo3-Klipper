# Klipper Config File for Elegoo Neptune 3 (WIP)

Base Klipper Config file for Klipper (based on the original code from [jerryngm](https://github.com/jerryngm/Neptune-Elegoo3-Klipper). **Use at your own risk!!** Please read the comments in the file, you will need to calibrate your hotend heater PID and E-steps   

## üìÑ **Done:**  
 ‚úîÔ∏è X Y Z E Steppers and Endstops 
 ‚úîÔ∏è Heaters and Fans  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Filament sensor  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Klipper's Pressure Advance  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Klipper's Input Sharper

## **üë®‚Äçüè´ Building Klipper Firmware**  
 
 The **Elegoo Neptune 3** printer uses a proprietary board called "ZNP Robin Nano_DW V2.1", but, according to the official Marlin [source code](https://github.com/NARUTOfzr/Neptune_3) from Elegoo this board is based on the "STM32F401" chipset and has the exact same pinout of the ["MKS Robin E3 V2"](https://github.com/NARUTOfzr/Neptune_3/blob/main/ZNP_F401_Marlin-V_1.0.3/Marlin/src/pins/stm32f4/pins_MKS_E3_V2.h) board.

 So, just use the following config in make menuconfig:
 - Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32)
 - Processor model (STM32F401)
 - Bootloader offset (32KiB bootloader)
 - Communication interface (Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9))

 Once compiled, copy klipper.bin to an SD card (root folder) then rename it to ZNP_ROBIN_NANO.bin, insert it to your Neptune then switch on. You can remove the official screen, it will become useless since it doesn't work with Klipper.
 
 **You can revert back to original firmware by placing the original firmware bin file to the SD card.**
 
 ## **üîß Installation**  

 1) First, compile and install the Klipper firmware according to the configuration above.
 
 2) My configuration file uses the official Z endstop sensor (not the probe). I notice that using the probe forced the printer to bump the nozzle with an unconfortable (at least to me) force into the bed. But, the official Elegoo sensor is very high, so, you need to calibrate the Z-Offset. Home the printer, calibrate the new Z-Offset using a paper (similar to manual bed leveling) and then save it as a *position_endstop*.
 
 3) Calibrate the probe offset, following the instructions here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html
 
 4) Do a PID calibration for the extruder heater and the bed, following the instructions here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html#calibrate-pid-settings
 
 5) Calibrate the extruder rotation_distance (I.e E-Steps): https://www.klipper3d.org/Rotation_Distance.html#calibrating-rotation_distance-on-extruders

 ## **üîß Advanced tuning** 
 
 For "Input Shaper" you can use an ADXL345 accelerometer. It is quite simple to attach it to the bed or the hotend and run the resonance tuning. For more details read the [official documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html). I will soon upload the pictures of how I attached my accelerometer.
 
 For "Pressure Advance" just follow the [official documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html) and use the configuration for "long bowden extruders".
